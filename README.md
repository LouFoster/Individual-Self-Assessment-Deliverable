# Individual-Self-Assessment-Deliverable

Module 21 Individual Self Assessment Deliverable

You can submit your one-page self-assessment via a link to a GitHub or Google document or by uploading a text file of your choice.

Requirements for the Self-Assessment (100 points)

The self-assessment is worth 1% of your final grade.
Before you submit the self-assessment deliverable, review the requirements for it.



Self-Assessment (40 points)

Your self-assessment should be a few paragraphs in length and meet the following requirements:

## •	Cohesive written analysis: Describes the role or roles that you played over the course of the project and the contribution of each of those roles to the project. This written analysis should also describe your greatest personal challenge over the course of the project and how you overcame it.

During the last few months, I have proudly worked on the following projects.

     ## In Module 2 (Stock Data Analysis) 

      In this module, as assigned Data Analyst, I helped Steve (the Client) analyze an entire dataset. In addition, to do a little more research for Steve’s parents, the client wants to expand the dataset to include the entire stock market over the last few years.

      Steve has given me, the Data Analyst, an Excel file containing the stock data he wants to be analyzed. As Data Analyst, I will be using an extension to Excel, built to automate tasks. Previously, Excel helped us start thinking about data differently; now, VBA will help us start thinking about how to analyze that data programmatically. 

      By the end of this module, as assigned Data Analyst, I completed the following:
      
      •	Create a VBA macro that can trigger pop-ups and inputs, read, and change cell values, and format cells.

      •	Use for loops and conditionals to direct logic flow.

      •	Use nested for loops.



#In Module 3, “Election Audit”

A Colorado board of election employee has given me the assigned Data Analysis the following tasks to complete the election audit of a recent local congressional election.
•	The voter turnout for each county

•	The percentage of votes from each county out of the total count

•	The county with the highest turnout

Finally, as assigned Data Analyst, I provided the clients with a written analysis of the election audit for the election commission, including the new results and a clearly written overview of your methods. As with all written analyses, this will help your audience understand what you did and what they might be able to do with the data you presented.


    #In Module 6, “PlanMyTrip”

      As the assigned Data Analysis I practiced analysis, visualization, and statistical skills by retrieving and analyzing weather data for a travel company, PlanMyTrip. Successfully completion of Module tasks drew upon, my knowledge of Python, decision and repetition statements, data structures, Pandas, and Matplotlib.



## •	Cohesive written summary: Describes how you contributed to each role that you didn’t play. This might have occurred via team discussions, peer reviews, or other means.

In Module 2 (Stock Data Analysis) 

After working with Steve (the Client) as assigned Data Analyst, we discovered the following about refactoring code 
Advantages of refactoring code

•	faster runtime, requiring fewer steps, less memory, and easier code readability for future users since it only loops through all the data one time.

•	more adaptability as it can handle larger datasets resulting in a measurable greater efficiency.

•	Due to the step-by-step structure of the code, logical errors are more easily recognized, especially code containing loops. 

Disadvantages of refactoring code
•	Complex code is usually best to split into several functions in order to spot errors and or coding issues.

•	refactoring code requires a meaningful understanding of the original in order to achieve maximum optimization.

Conclusion: How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script
•	As per our results, the refactored code allowed for a faster runtime; see attached screenshots.

•	A clean organized code with the enhanced ability to make changes, which are more easily manageable.

•	refactoring code adds additional time to produce a final product as it most would require additional time spent working to optimize the code. 


In Module 3, #Election-Audit Results

Election-Audit Summary
While learning Python, reviewing the code, and building a sound script for analysis, I believe as Data Analyst, one can become so focused on a single aspect instead of considering all factors and or variables that one could miss some creative ways to look at the data. For example, many real-world coding programs require mathematical calculations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. To perform these calculations in Python, several arithmetic operators are used, which may sometimes present a slight challenge. Nonetheless, I propose that the election commission can use the PyPoll_Challenge.py script with some modifications.

Additional Analysis
Further analysis of the election data led to questions on the calculation of the voter turnout for each county that voted in the congressional district. How to calculate the percentage of votes each county contributed to the election. We also asked to determine which county had the largest turnout.



Project and Team Summary (60 points)

The project summary should be a two paragraph written analysis that summarizes the project, illustrates the teamwork of the group, and documents lessons learned. The summary should be written as if to be used in an interview or cover letter, and includes all of the following:

•	Communication protocols used,  including any challenges, how they were resolved, and what they would do differently next time

Communication protocols used, == Slack, Personal Email, and holding additional Zoom meeting to coordinate team tasks and efforts for our final project/presentation. 

•	Team strengths, including tips and tricks they would want to share with a new cohort kicking off the project

Start early!!! Although “C-Group” initial outlined the Project Objective, and Goals and Expected results, some of our initial Goals were not achieved due to lack of resources and time to fully execute our data analysis.

•	Topic addressed: Weather Air Quality and Critical Weather Attributed
